        <p>You need muscle on your body to increase your metabolism. We lose
        muscle as we get older. The only way to keep it is through strength
        training.<\p>
        <p>Welcome to your Thanksgiving Turkey Burner!<\p>
        <p>Love or hate it, YOU NEED IT. This is four blocks. Each exercise is
        done for 30 seconds. Each block has three exercises, and we're going to
        do it two times through. Focus on the 30 seconds only and don't think
        about what's ahead or what's behind. Focus on the moment.<\p>
        <p>Diane on the left will be showing modifications. Own your exercises
        and choose wisely.<\p>
        <p>Jennifer on the right will be doing all of the advanced options,
        making them a little bit higher. If you want that extra push, stick with
        Jennifer.<\p>
        <p>We even have a DJ today!</p>

      description: |
        <p>Jen from the YMCA of the North takes you on a Flow class. Grab your
        yoga mat and begin with your feet hip-width apart.<\p>
        <p>As we flow today, we encourage you to listen to your bodies.
        Modifications are shown by Amy and Diane to meet your needs. You can
        follow along at any level that serves you best.<\p>
        <p>Blink your eyes closed, and begin to notice how you feel. Bring
        awareness to this moment with a softness to your face and jaw. Today
        let's bring our attention and our focus to gratitude. Feeling grateful
        for our bodies and how they move and bend and lift us. Feeling grateful
        for our minds--how they dream and think and wonder. And feeling grateful
        for our spirits and how they connect us to one another and our hope and
        joy and peace.<\p>
        <p>Start to imagine your heart. The heart chakra is the color green. Can
        you imagine a shiny green emerald glowing from your heart? Now we wrap
        our breath around our body, mind, and spirit...and the spirit of
        gratitude around our heart center as we notice our breath and take you
        on a journey through gratitude.</p>

      title: 'Daily Meditation: Discomfort and the Necessity to Grow'
      description: |
        <p>What is the relationship between your physical reality and mental
        reality? Teachers describe a difference between your emotions and your
        feelings. Emotions are a reaction to your outer world, while feelings
        are how you take those emotions and let them manifest. This practice of
        self-discipline and self-knowledge. Today we are discussing the feeling
        and emotion of discomfort.<\p>
        <p>No one wants to be uncomfortable, but what is beyond that
        conditioning? More and more science is showing us that a small amount of
        discomfort is necessary. That's what today's practice is about: getting
        to know ourselves and that temporary emotion of discomfort and finding a
        new way to visualize what that means for our body and mind.<\p>
        <p>Breathe deeply today and let's grow together as we adapt to the
        feelings of discomfort.</p>

      description: |
        <p>How do you be your best self in any situation you have in your
        life?<\p>
        <p>We all live very different lives and within our lives, we all play a
        variety of roles.<\p>
        <p>We relate to people around us<\p>
        <p>in completely different ways<\p>
        <p>we have bosses, or kids, or significant others,<\p>
        <p>or parents,<\p>
        <p>or whatever!<\p>
        <p>And all of these people benefit when we show up as our best
        selves.<\p>
        <p>So determining what that is... takes a little... meditation.<\p>
        <p>Center yourself and visualize yourself at your very best. Bring a

      description: |
        <p>Good morning!<\p>
        <p>Today, we are going to focus on the power of light. When people think
        of meditation they think of words like enlightenment. Enlightenment can
        be a profound topic. You may have a rough definition in your mind and
        everyone probably has a different personal experience of what they
        believe it means. Chance views it as a functional term. To make yourself
        lighter. With that terminology, imagine what emotions like resentment.
        Scarcity. Fear. Defensiveness. Judgment. Imagine what those things feel
        like in your body? Those feelings rest in your body as heaviness and
        weigh you down. They grip. They block. Those thoughts don't feel good,
        even though they may feel comfortable.<\p>
        <p>Journey with me today as we experience lightness.</p>

        <p>Today's practice is centered around creating space for what you need
        today. That might be something physical. That might be something
        abstract like courage or curiosity. You might be looking just to breathe
        and to be. Just take a moment with your eyes closed and think about what
        you might want to create space for in our practice today.<\p>
